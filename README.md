## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.0 or later)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun package manager

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/betuloran/feasta-app.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd feasta-app
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

## Development
To run the development server:
   ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
   ```
  Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

## API Routes
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/products. The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/* and files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Editing
You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Production Build
To build the application for production:
  ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
   ```

## Technologies Used
- Next.js: React framework for production with SSR and SSG capabilities
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript features
- CSS3: Styling and responsive design
- Geist Font: Optimized font family for better performance
